## Proposal:XGboost model for slecting impotant features of stock and forming  unlinear factor 
### Motivation
We know that maching learning can be use to select important features for predictding stocks' performance.In factor investment, people want to find factors that is highly correlated with the return of stock, so we want to use machinglearning to  select the important factors.Besides, when we use the maching learning model to predict the performance of the stock, the prediction itself can be seen as a factor, because if maching learning model works,then the return of investment based on the prediction should be highly correlated with model's prediction.So we want use maching learning model to produce a factor.
